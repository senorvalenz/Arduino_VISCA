# Arduino_VISCA
Control a Sony VISCA Controller with an Arduino, if you're into that sort of thing.

Developed and tested with a Sony EVID-70, but it should work with any camera using the VISCA protocol via RS-232.

Last built and tested in 2015 using ~Arduino 2.1, so it's possible things have changed since then üôè

VISCA_Controller_v1_02.ino is the main file.  All other files contain functions.
